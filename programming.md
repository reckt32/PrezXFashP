### Many of you would be interested in learning how to code!

The journey to learn programming is not straightforward, and the term programming itself is an umbrella term for a lot of different things.

Some of you may want to build a website or an app for your startup idea, some of you might want to do competitive programming, or some of you just want to get started and explore from there.

### Setting up Your IDE

Before diving into coding, the first step is to set up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). A popular choice is **VSCode**, loved for its simplicity and versatility. Download and set it up, and you'll be ready to start writing your first lines of code.

### Choosing Your First Programming Language

When you're just starting, you don't need to focus on learning a specific language. Instead, it's more important to grasp the **fundamental concepts of programming**. These concepts will make it easier for you to pick up any language or technology in the future.

#### The Best Language for Beginners
One of the most popular languages you might have heard of is **Python**. It's powerful, has a simple syntax, and is widely used in areas like machine learning and data science. However, for someone new to programming, we recommend avoiding Python initially because it abstracts many important programming concepts.

A great first choice is **C**, which is commonly taught in the first-year computer programming courses. C allows you to get closer to understanding how computers work by teaching you about memory management and other core concepts.

If you're looking for a structured way to start, **CS50**, Harvard’s Introduction to Computer Science, is one of the best free courses available online. It teaches core programming fundamentals while offering a hands-on approach to problem-solving, covering C, Python, web development, and more. The course is designed for complete beginners and provides a deep understanding of how computers and programming work. You can find it on platforms like **edX**, and it's highly recommended for both complete beginners and those looking to solidify their foundation.

### Resources to Get You Started

There are many free resources available online for learning, and we advise not spending money on courses when you can learn so much for free. For example, **freeCodeCamp.org** is an excellent website that offers comprehensive tutorials for web development and more.

For C programming, YouTube is full of great tutorials. A popular recommendation is **Code with Harry**, known for his beginner-friendly approach.

### Build Projects, Don’t Just Watch

While learning, it's crucial to build projects rather than just watching tutorials or coding along. Building something practical will help solidify the concepts you're learning.

If you're interested in diving into specific areas like **Web Development, App Development**, or even **Game Development**, you'll find many resources and roadmaps online. We've compiled some for you, and you'll find them attached.

### AI/ML – The Future is Now

If you're interested in **AI/ML**, you're not alone! The buzz around machine learning is massive, and it's a field with endless opportunities. One of the most popular starting points is **Stanford CS229 by Andrew Ng**, which offers a clear introduction to ML. Additionally, our Developers’ Society will soon start the **ML vertical inductions**, where you'll learn by doing weekly assignments and hands-on projects.

This is just the beginning of your coding journey. Once you start, the possibilities are endless. Programming is a tool that lets you bring your ideas to life by making machines do amazing things with just your command.
